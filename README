Using an Upek fingerprint reader for 2D scrolling and middle mouse button.

You need the Upek SDK for this to work from:
http://www.upek.com/solutions/pc_and_networking/sdks/linux/

The scolling has a feature of inertia to allow one to efficiently scroll 
large distances. The parameters can be adjusted in the source file.

A small word of caution: The binary blob from Upek fires a timer about 1000 
times per second. These wakeups give an additional 2 Watts of power usage 
on my laptop, I therefore disable this when running on battery power.
More caution: There appears to be a bug in the code that makes it crash if 
you compile with high optimizations. If you find it, please let me know.

The licence on the code:
Do whatever you want with it, but drop me a word if you use it or did 
something awesome with it ;-).
